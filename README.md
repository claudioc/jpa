Hi,

I am the tech director of a small German startup;

I see in Github you are using the "Remagine" username and since you are not using it since 2 years ago I wonder if it would be possible to rename it to something else so we could use it?

You can contact me at claudio@getconsciousgrowth.com

That would be great :)

Have a great day,
